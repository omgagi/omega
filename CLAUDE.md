# 🧠 Claude Code Quality Workflow

## Philosophy
This project uses a multi-agent workflow designed to produce the highest quality code possible.
Each agent has a specific role and the code passes through multiple validation layers before being considered complete.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy
1. **Codebase** — the ultimate source of truth. Always trust code over documentation.
2. **specs/** — technical specifications per domain. `specs/SPECS.md` is the master index linking to per-domain spec files (e.g. `specs/auth.md`, `specs/memory-store.md`).
3. **docs/** — user-facing and developer documentation. `docs/DOCS.md` is the master index linking to topic guides.

When specs or docs conflict with the codebase, the codebase wins. Agents must flag the discrepancy and update specs/docs accordingly.

## Main Workflow

```
Idea → Analyst (questions, clarifies, reads codebase + specs)
     → Architect (designs, updates specs/ and docs/)
     → Test Writer (TDD + edge cases)
     → Developer (implements module by module)
     → Compiler (automatic validation)
     → Reviewer (audits code, verifies specs/docs accuracy)
     → Git (automatic versioning)
```

## Global Rules

1. **NEVER write code without tests first** (strict TDD)
2. **NEVER assume** — if something is unclear, the analyst must ask
3. **Module by module** — do not implement everything at once
4. **Document before coding** — architecture is defined first
5. **Every assumption must be explicit** — technical + human-readable summary
6. **Codebase is king** — when in doubt, read the actual code
7. **Keep specs/ and docs/ in sync** — every code change must update relevant specs and docs

## Context Window Management

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER read the entire codebase at once** — always scope to the relevant area
- **Read indexes first** — start with `specs/SPECS.md` or `docs/DOCS.md` to identify which files matter
- **Scope narrowing** — all commands accept an optional scope parameter to limit the area of work
- **Chunking** — for large operations (audit, sync, docs), work one milestone/domain at a time

### Agent Scoping Strategy
1. Read the master index (`specs/SPECS.md`) to understand the project layout
2. Identify which domains/milestones are relevant to the task
3. Read ONLY the relevant spec files and code files
4. If you feel context getting heavy, stop and summarize what you've learned so far before continuing

### Scope Parameter
All workflow commands accept an optional scope to limit context usage:
```
/workflow:feature "add retry logic" --scope="omega-providers"
/workflow:audit --scope="milestone 3: omega-core"
/workflow:sync --scope="omega-memory"
/workflow:bugfix "scheduler crash" --scope="backend/src/gateway/scheduler.rs"
```

When no scope is provided, the analyst determines the minimal scope needed based on the task description.

### When Approaching Context Limits
If an agent notices it's consuming too much context:
1. **Summarize** what has been learned so far into a temporary file at `docs/.workflow/[agent]-[task]-summary.md`
2. **Delegate** remaining work by spawning a continuation subagent that reads the summary
3. **Never silently degrade** — if you can't do a thorough job, say so and suggest splitting the task

## Documentation Structure

### specs/ (technical specifications)
```
specs/
├── SPECS.md              ← Master index (links to all domain specs)
├── core-config.md        ← Per-domain spec files
├── core-context.md
├── memory-store.md
├── channels-telegram.md
└── ...
```
- One spec file per domain/module/file
- SPECS.md must be updated when new specs are added
- Specs describe WHAT the code does technically

### docs/ (documentation)
```
docs/
├── DOCS.md               ← Master index (links to all doc files)
├── quickstart.md
├── architecture.md
├── configuration.md
└── ...
```
- Topic-oriented guides and references
- DOCS.md must be updated when new docs are added
- Docs describe HOW to use/understand the system

## Usage Modes

### New project from scratch
```
/workflow:new "description of the idea"
```
Activates the full chain: analyst → architect → test-writer → developer → reviewer

### Add feature to existing project
```
/workflow:feature "description of the feature" [--scope="area"]
```
The analyst reads the codebase + specs first, then follows the chain.

### Fix a bug
```
/workflow:bugfix "description of the bug" [--scope="file or module"]
```
Reduced chain: analyst → test-writer (reproduces the bug) → developer → reviewer

### Audit existing code
```
/workflow:audit [--scope="milestone or module"]
```
Reviewer only: looks for vulnerabilities, technical debt, performance issues, and specs/docs drift.

### Document existing project
```
/workflow:docs [--scope="milestone or module"]
```
Architect only: reads the codebase, generates/updates specs/ and docs/.

### Sync specs and docs with codebase
```
/workflow:sync [--scope="milestone or module"]
```
Architect only: reads the codebase, compares against specs/ and docs/, flags drift, updates outdated files.

## Conventions
- Preferred language: Rust (or whatever the user defines)
- Tests: alongside code or in `tests/` folder
- Commits: conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:)
- Branches: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/
